# bread-n-butter

**EXPERIMENTAL: Do not use in production**

bread-n-butter (bnb) is a parser combinator library for TypeScript and
JavaScript.

With relatively little code and no build step, you can get a proper parser
prepared for the language or input of your choice. A few functions and methods,
paired with a bit of regular expression experience, is all you need.

bnb has zero dependencies and is about 1.5 KB minified and gzipped (about 12 KB
raw compiled JS from TypeScript source).

bnb has 100% test coverage and full documentation. bnb supports ES2015
JavaScript environments (roughly: any modern browser (not IE), and any long term
support Node.js release).

## Installation

```shell
npm i bread-n-butter
```

## Usage

If you are using ES modules through TypeScript/webpack and npm:

```js
import * as bnb from "bread-n-butter";
```

If you are using Node.js require:

```js
const bnb = require("bread-n-butter");
```

If you are using ES modules natively in the browser without npm, download the [ES modules build](https://unpkg.com/bread-n-butter/dist/esm/bread-n-butter.js):

```js
import * as bnb from "./bread-n-butter.js";
```

## Getting Started

bnb is a [parser combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator)
library. You can build up complex parsers using combinators (functions that take
parsers and return parsers).

bnb is heavily inspired by [parsimmon](https://github.com/jneen/parsimmon), but
written in TypeScript and targeting modern JavaScript engines only.

## Tutorial

Check out the [tutorial](/tutorial) for help getting started.

## Examples

See [the examples](https://github.com/wavebeem/bread-n-butter/tree/main/examples) on
GitHub for how to implement various language parsers using bnb.

## API

Read the [full API documentation](/api) for more information about every
function.

Also, if you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and
have installed bnb through npm, you should get automatic API completion with
inline documentation so you can save time by never leaving your editor.
